## snaq-covid
Welcome to our poject page!
Our objective is to testing the limits of phylogenetic network method SNaQ with genomic datasets

If you want to do phylogenetic analysis, you can check scripts under `scripts_for_snaq` and `scripts/TICR/scripts` folder.
Scripts under `scripts_for_snaq` utilize scripts under `scripts/TICR/scripts` to do complete phylogenetic network analysis with different sample sizes (from genomic data to networks)

To get the detailed information, please go to `scripts_for_snaq`

Under `frog` folder, there are genetrees input data for different species of frog and the phylogenetic network outputs.
